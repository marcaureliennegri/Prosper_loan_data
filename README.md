# Loan Data Exploration

# Prosper_loan_data
This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, and its objective is to explore Prosper Loans dataset and uncover actionable insights using exploratory and explanatory data analysis techniques.

This project is meant to unveil any sort of insights from my data exploration.

# Dataset
The data consists of information regarding 113,937 loans granted by Prosper, including Prosper score or borrower risk, listing category or loan type, employment status, number of current credit lines, number of open revolving accounts, debt to income ratio, and original loan amount. The dataset can be found in Udacity's repository [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit?usp=sharing).

# Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found several interesting relationships between the dependent variable (LoanSatus) and these selected borrowers features: Prosper score or borrower risk, original loan amount, Income verifiable, Homeowner, and debt to income ratio. I choose to present only the loan statuses distribution and its relationship with the variables listed above, but debt to income ratio. The reason for my decision was to improve the storytelling follow and generate meaningful insights.

I have performed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis to get a good sense of existing distribution and relationship in the dataset. My analysis focused of correlations/causations of Prosper score as well as loan amounts lent.


As seen, having your income verifiable helps you to have a lower APR. Evenly, to be a homeowner is helpful in order to get a higher loan amount, which is not surprising since higher incomes are more likely to have a property, and a better prosper score.

As an advice to future Prosper loans applicants, make sure you have your income verified even if you are not among the lucky ones to have a high income and/or a property!
